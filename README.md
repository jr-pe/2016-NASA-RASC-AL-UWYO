Project Information
=========================================
Twice the wheels, twice the collection arms and buckets, twice the rovers, twice the success. In this spirit, the Cowboy Robotics team at the University of Wyoming has developed a feasible multi-rover plan with which it intends to take-on the 2016 NASA RASC-AL Robo-Ops competition. This unique system of two rovers will work together in such a way as to achieve feats impossible using any single rover, providing a significant advantage over other competitors. With the resources, facilities, and workforce to bring this plan to life, these rovers will be fully operational and ready for the competition in May of 2016. In addition to building a rover for the 2016 Robo-Ops competition, this project will be the vanguard of a new era of robotics research at the University of Wyoming.
