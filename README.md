Project Information
=========================================
Twice the wheels, twice the collection arms and buckets, twice the rovers, twice the success. In this spirit, the Cowboy Robotics team at the University of Wyoming has developed a feasible multi-rover plan with which it intends to take-on the 2016 NASA RASC-AL Robo-Ops competition. This unique system of two rovers will work together in such a way as to achieve feats impossible using any single rover, providing a significant advantage over other competitors. With the resources, facilities, and workforce to bring this plan to life, these rovers will be fully operational and ready for the competition in May of 2016. In addition to building a rover for the 2016 Robo-Ops competition, this project will be the vanguard of a new era of robotics research at the University of Wyoming.

Directory Listing
=========================================
* **Source:** This is where you should place all of your source code.  If your project
  uses multiple languages, you may find it useful to have subdirectories, e.g.,
  Source/java, Source/html, Source/images, etc.  If you are using an IDE that has
  a project directory, you may wish to start the project here.  For example, the
  Source directory could contain an Xcode project repository or a VisualStudio
  project.

* **Documents:** Here will be the documents you write to describe your project.  The
  boiler plate includes a use case template and a sample use case.  Both of these
  are taken from [Cockburn's use cases website][1], which contains many other useful tips
  on writing effective use cases (as does his book).  The use cases are written
  down in [Markdown][2] format.  You may convert them to your word processor of
  choice.  This folder also includes a sample specification document from a real
  software company.  That is a good example of what a requirements document for this
  class should look like.

* **Resources:** This is where you can place files that are useful to your project.
  For example, you may place here helpful articles downloaded from the internet.
