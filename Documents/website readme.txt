I have first created my own version of the website using my knowledge that I gained from (Client side programming class), which consisted of (HTML, CSS, ... etc). 

Laer on, the team decided to use Wordpress for it being easier for them to use I assume, then, after they got the domain name and the website from Wordpress. I put my touch if I may say on it.
